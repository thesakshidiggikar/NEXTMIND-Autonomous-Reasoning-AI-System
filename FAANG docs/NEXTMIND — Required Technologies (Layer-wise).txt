🟢 1️⃣ Core Programming (Mandatory)
✅ Python
Reason:
    ML + AI research ka primary language
    FAANG interviews me expected
You should know:
    Async programming
    OOP + design patterns
    Type hints

🟢 2️⃣ AI / ML Foundation (VERY IMPORTANT)
✅ Machine Learning:
    Scikit-learn
    Feature engineering
    Evaluation beyond accuracy

✅ Deep Learning:
    PyTorch (preferred for research)
    Neural networks basics
    Training loops

Custom loss functions
📌 FAANG prefers PyTorch for research-heavy roles.

🟢 3️⃣ Reinforcement Learning (CORE of NEXTMIND)
✅ Reinforcement Learning:
Use for:
    Curiosity reward
    Exploration vs exploitation
    Meta-controller decisions
Concepts:
    Reward design
    Policy updates
    Bandits / RL-lite is enough for MVP
Libraries:
    Stable-Baselines3 (optional)
    Custom RL loop (better for learning)

🟢 4️⃣ Curiosity & Bayesian Reasoning
✅ Bayesian Statistics
Used in:
    Hypothesis confidence
    Uncertainty estimation
Concepts:
    Bayesian inference
    Posterior probability
    Confidence intervals
Libraries:
    PyMC / NumPy based implementation

🟢 5️⃣ LLMs (As a TOOL, Not Brain)
✅ Large Language Models
Use for:
    Hypothesis generation
    Experiment plan drafting
    Reasoning templates

Important:
❌ Don’t say “LLM does everything”
✅ Say “LLM assists structured reasoning”
Libraries:
    OpenAI API / open-source LLM
    LangChain (light usage)
    Custom prompt pipelines

🟢 6️⃣ Knowledge & Memory Layer
✅ Vector Databases
Purpose:
    Concept memory
    Similar hypothesis retrieval
Options:
    FAISS
    Chroma

✅ Knowledge Graph
Purpose:
    Store relations between ideas
    Scientific memory

Options:
    NetworkX (simple)
    Neo4j (advanced, optional)

🟢 7️⃣ Data Engineering & Pipelines
✅ Experiment Tracking
Purpose:
    Versioning experiments
    Reproducibility
Tools:
    MLflow
    Weights & Biases (optional)

✅ Async Task Execution
Purpose:
    Parallel experiments
Options:
    Celery + Redis
    Python asyncio (MVP friendly)

🟢 8️⃣ Backend & System Design
✅ FastAPI
Purpose:
    API layer
    Control system
Why FAANG likes it:
    Clean
    Scalable
    Modern

✅ System Design Concepts
You must know:
    Stateless services
    Queues
    Failure handling
    Scalability

🟢 9️⃣ Infrastructure (Basic but Important)
✅ Docker
    Containerize experiments
    Reproducible runs

✅ Cloud Basics
    AWS / GCP basics
    Compute vs storage trade-offs
    (Advanced infra not needed for MVP)

🟢 1️⃣0️⃣ Monitoring & Metrics (Underrated but FAANG Loves)
✅ Metrics & Logging
Track:
    Knowledge gain
    Hypothesis survival rate
    Experiment cost
Tools:
    Custom dashboards
    Prometheus-style thinking (even if manual)
